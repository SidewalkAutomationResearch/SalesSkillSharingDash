# Sales Skills Dashboard - Project Plan

**Date & Time:** 2025-07-25 

## Current Issue & Recovery Plan

The medium dark mode implementation has broken the application. User requested: "That broke everything. revert to previous build, then make a basic very dark gray background with red and blue color as appropriate. push"

## To-Do Items

- [ ] Revert to previous working build (before dark theme broke everything)
- [ ] Implement new dark theme with very dark gray background
- [ ] Use red and blue colors appropriately in the new theme
- [ ] Update all component styling to match new theme
- [ ] Test the application thoroughly
- [ ] Commit and push changes to GitHub
- [ ] Write completion rap with Joe Bosh reference

## Implementation Plan

1. **Revert Changes**: Use git to revert to the last working state
2. **New Theme Design**: Implement very dark gray (#1a1a1a or similar) background
3. **Color Palette**: 
   - Background: Very dark gray
   - Primary actions/success: Blue tones
   - Warnings/alerts: Red tones
   - Text: Light gray/white for contrast
4. **Component Updates**: Update all components to use the new theme
5. **Testing**: Ensure all functionality works correctly
6. **Deployment**: Push to GitHub repository
